## **BPSK**

* ###  Description
        BPSK is the simplest (Binary) form of phase shift keying (PSK).
        It uses two phases which are separated by 180° and so can also be termed 2-PSK.

## **QPSK**

* ###  Description
        Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) is one of PSK forms.
        QPSK uses four points on the constellation diagram, equispaced around a circle.
        With four phases, QPSK can encode two bits per symbol to minimize the bit error rate (BER) — sometimes misperceived as twice the BER of BPSK.

## **FSK**

* ###  Description
        Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a frequency modulation scheme in which digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of a carrier signal.
        The simplest FSK is binary FSK (BFSK) which I have used.
        BFSK uses a pair of discrete frequencies to transmit binary (0s and 1s) information. With this scheme, the "1" is called the mark frequency and the "0" is called the space frequency.

## **QAM 16**

* ###  Description
        Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information.
        It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme.
        The two carrier waves of the same frequency are out of phase with each other by 90°, a condition known as orthogonality and as quadrature.
        Since in digital telecommunications the data is usually binary, the number of points in the grid is usually a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, …).
        Since QAM is usually square, some of these are rare — the most common forms are 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM.
        So this (QAM-16) is one of the most common forms of QAM.
